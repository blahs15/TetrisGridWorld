# Tetris
This was an extra program I wrote in my AP Computer Science class in high school.  It uses the APCS's case study GridWorld which sets up the UI for you.  Because it uses this, I am not sure whether the game can be run easily because it imports the GridWorld code.  I tried to find the GridWorld file and include it in this repository, but it is untested.
This was a fun, mini, side project I worked on.  It took me only about 8 hours to get working in one afternoon, with a few minor bugs that were fixed in the following weeks, along with a feature addition.
